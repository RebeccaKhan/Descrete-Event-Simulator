# Descrete-Event-Simulator

In this programming assignment, we will implement a Discrete Event Simulator (DES) of a
GI/GI/1/S/âˆž queuing system. The simulator should be programmed in Python in an object-oriented fashion for the sake of simple extensibility and re-usability.
The assignment consists of 6 parts. As a first step, we will have to create the basic functionality of your
simulator. After that, we will have to extend it step by step to make simulations and analyze
the results.
